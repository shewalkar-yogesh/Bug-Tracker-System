# 🐞 Bug Tracker System

A full-stack bug tracking platform that allows users to log, assign, and manage software issues with real-time status tracking and role-based access control. This project simulates a real-world issue tracking environment for developers, testers, and project managers.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary

- **Goal:** Create a bug tracking system with multi-role access and secure authentication.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for internal team use in software companies to manage bugs and issues efficiently.
- **Roles:** Admin, Developer, Tester — each with distinct access privileges.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **API Architecture:** RESTful APIs

---

## ✨ Features

- Secure user authentication using JWT  
- Role-based access (Admin, Developer, Tester)  
- Report, assign, and update bug status  
- Dashboard to view and filter issues by status or priority  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile views

---

## 💡 Key Highlights

- Developed an end-to-end MERN application with a focus on backend security and frontend usability  
- Implemented **JWT authentication** and middleware for protected routes  
- Designed MongoDB schemas for users and bugs with access-level enforcement  
- Emulated real-world collaboration workflow across roles

## 📌 Why This Project?

This system replicates how real software teams manage issues using tools like Jira or Bugzilla. It helped me practice:
- Role-based access implementation  
- Authentication flow using tokens  
- REST API design and stateful UI development  
- Full-stack architecture with modular backend and dynamic frontend

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building real-world, multi-user systems using the **MERN stack**  
- Implementing **secure auth** and role management from scratch  
- Structuring backend services using clean MVC patterns  
- Designing and consuming REST APIs efficiently

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add comment system and activity logs  
- Enable email notifications for status changes  
- Implement unit tests and role-based test coverage  
- Deploy on cloud using AWS/GCP for public access
